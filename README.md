# Task4

This is my Task4 submission to 10academy.
I followed the steps below 

Some useful steps to do that is as follows
Install mysql community and create a database
Write an sql file (schema ) that creates Tables IF Not Exists, Drop Tables
Insert / Update Data into the created Tables and Databases above.
Read data from the tables and display it on streamlit/Flask.
The web app should have two pages or more and selection of the data to be displayed e.g show data belonging from a particular user
Design different plots that show different analyses of the data.
